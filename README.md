The NoteCloud - project is a web application designed to simplify task management, providing users with a platform to create, edit and delete scheduled tasks. With an intuitive, simple interface and features, NoteCloud allows individuals to organize their daily activities.

<p>Main features:</p>

- `Create tasks` Easily create new priority tasks and place them in separate task blocks.
- `Editing tasks` Change the task name or update its priority, and if necessary, rename the block in which the task group is located.
- `Delete tasks` Easily delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed, or delete their entire block at once.
- `User-friendly interface` Thanks to the DaisyUI user interface library, an intuitive design has been developed to make task management easy for users of all levels.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
